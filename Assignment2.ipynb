    "Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "Classes may generate instances (objects), and have per-instance state (instance variables). Modules may be mixed in to classes and other modules. The mixed in module's constants and methods blend into that class's own, augmenting the class's functionality. Classes, however, cannot be mixed in to anything."

    "The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class."
